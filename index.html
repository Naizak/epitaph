      <h1>I dedicate this epitaph to my beloved witch, Beatrice.</h1>

      <p>
        Welcome to my island! <br />A Universe built by one! <br />My Golden
        Land! <br />You who seek the treasure of my Golden Land, know that you
        will be blessed only at a probability of a quadrillion to one. If you
        still seek the treasure you must first uncover both secrets to find the
        key. One shall be the secret of the flowers! As you set out, know that
        light will always guide your way. But be warned, although the moon
        speaks the truth, the sun always lies. Let the pillar of light, engulfed
        by the earth, lead you to the source to life itself! Once there, learn
        the language of the flowers to uncover their secret.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another shall be the secret of song! Stop and listen! For When the
        Umineko Cry, the song of hope will enlighten you on the path forward.
        However, try as hard as you are able, the secret of song shall not
        reveal itself to those who only look in this universe. This has been
        decreed by the Witch of Certainty, λΔ herself! The magic of her namesake
        guarantees it!
      </p>
      <p>
        The one who obtains the key must then travel to the treasure of the
        Golden Land in accordance with these rules: <br />* Let the light at the
        center of all things turn you away from the sun's deceit. <br />* Behold
        the native fruit of my land beckoning, from their location they can see
        what the light is hiding in the horizon. <br />* Give yourself
        completely to the golden light! Have faith and descend!
      </p>
      <p>
        For only those who believe shall be shown the treasure of my Golden
        Land!
